encode string using different ways
## hope u can correct my mistakes in english
i guess there are some grammar errors in English,  for my mother language is Chinese, if there is sth wrong, hope u can help me correct it, please.
## the usage of these codes?
u can use them to encode your passwd or sth like that

e.g. u can use a simple rule to set your passwd and encode it using this program

in this way, you only have to memorize simple meaningful strings while copying the cipher somewhere
